## Powerful Android App Testing Insights

Use Ansight to record, replay and analyse testing sessions of your Android apps.

Simplify your teams communication; talk about how to solve the bug, not how to replicate it.

Ansight records a screen-capture alongside the device logs and lets you replay them side by side.

Ansight is plug and play ðŸ”Œ

 * It does not require any SDK's to be added to your apps.
 * It does not require any app's to be installed onto a users device.
 * Compatible with all Android development frameworks and tools.

Once developer mode is enabled on a device, users can simply plug their device into their computer and start recording.
